    "question": "In Gloomhaven, players choose scenarios where they usually have to kill all the monsters. In this scenario, it's currently the monsters' turn. In order, each monster will take its turn moving to the closest hex adjacent to a player's character and then attack, following these rules: 1. Monster 1 starts first and follows these rules and completes their turn, then Monster 2 will take their turn, followed by Monster 3 and then Monster 4. 2. Each monster on their turn finds the closest unattacked character to them using a legal path. See rule 4 for what is considered a legal path. 3. The monster then moves until they are adjacent to the target character. 4. Spaces that contain obstacles, characters, or the original monster locations are not considered hexes, so the monsters cannot move through these. All other spaces are considered hexes. 5. Record the monster movement by drawing lines below. Note that each monster has a hit point value, indicating how much more damage needs to be done to kill them. These hit point values might shift the players' priorities. When the monsters' turn is over, the characters have all survived! What is it the characters are hoping to do on their turn?",

Moonshine's mushroom patch in the Crick is filled with different types of mushrooms. One particular type of mushroom, the Tasty Toadstool, needs to be watered extremely often. However, Moonshine has forgotten where the Tasty Toadstools are growing, and all the different spores look the same! Luckily, the Tasty Toadstools feel different from the rest of the other mushrooms. At the top of each column and on the left of each row, she's marked the number of Tasty Toadstools that are growing adjacent to one another.

    "question": "The final stop on our road trip \u2013 the famous Cue Club in Las Vegas, NV. To our surprise, we find an adorable kid fumbling with a cue stick twice his size. \"I bet you fifty dollars I can knock in these nine balls in nine shots!\" he says to us. We laugh: \"OK, but you gotta call each shot before you sink it.\" We're pretty sure this kid is so young, he'd have trouble just counting 1 to 9, let alone sinking all nine balls in a row. \"Sounds fair,\" he says. Though the kid's baby face makes him look like an easy mark, his two-piece, custom-made pool cue should definitely have been a red flag! He looks at the table a few seconds and then takes out a piece of paper and a pencil, quickly writes out a note and hands it to us: Using Roman numerals and no spaces, the order in which I will sink the balls in their pockets will be IIVIIVIIIIIVIIIIVIXIV. Three balls will be dropped into the TLC pocket, and their numbers will all be less than 6. Three balls will be dropped into the BLC pocket, and their numbers will all be greater than 4. Two balls will be dropped into the RS pocket, and their numbers will have a difference of 5. The 9 ball will be dropped into the TRC pocket. No two sequential shots will go into the same pocket. Three shots in a row will all go into pockets at the top of the table. \"You got it?\" he asks, smugly. Then, without warning, the fumbling baby-face child morphs into a smooth-movin' baby-shark. He is amazing, sinking shot after shot \u2013 sometimes with balls jumping over other balls \u2013 and he always manages to stop the cue ball right where it contacts the ball he is sinking. Nine shots later, we're reaching for our wallets. We definitely \"got it!\"",

Buzz was a great fan of cooking, though his past endeavors were half-baked at best. After shopping, he brought back 14 words to make his favorite food, Word Salad. Partway through his prep, his wife walked in. \"What are you doing?\" she asked, worried about what he was cooking up. \"I was just...I wanted to eat something...different,\" he stuttered. \"Never mince words!\" his wife shouted. But it was too late; Buzz had already cut the original words to pieces and was about to blend pairs of them into something scrumptious. When he had finished, Buzz had a meal that actually made the cut. What did Buzz's wife do that evening?",
