He called out to the man to ask what he was doing. \"It's quite simple, my boy,\" he began. \"My townspeople have rejected me and thrown me out. So, I cast nine times into the pond, each at a given length of line to see if I could catch some fish. I intend to give my neighbors a piece of herring.\" With that, the water churned as all the fish scrambled to bite the hooks, not once crossing lines with each other. Strangely, Milo noticed that the lines turned at right angles; he thought to himself, \"Aha, Gil must be an angler!\" Milo helped Gil reel in one fish per side before returning to the other. Each and every line snapped in their combined effort, and when they had lost all 9 fish back to the pond, Gil fell to the grass exhaustedly. Milo found a stick and wrote the letters he'd seen in the dirt. \"It's no use! With no way to restring the poles, I've nothing to get my revenge!\" Gil began to sob, and revealing his true intentions. When he finished, Milo looked in surprise at what he had written. What did even the fish realize Gil was?",

Each week, she'd host a speed dating event for the words who'd wandered into town for a spell, setting up pairs of them in the tops of trees around the village. \"Isn't it wonderful?\" she exclaimed, \"even in the hearts of words, opposites attract! Hopefully they'll be willing to take a risk and make the connection.\" Harmony searched for what the attracted pairs were outside of their connection to each other. And as time went on those couples who'd crossed paths with two other couples offered the best advice for dating: telling exactly where a word would have to go out to find their perfect match.",
